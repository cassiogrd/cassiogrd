## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 28-year-old software developer with two years of experience in C#. I have dual citizenship (Portuguese and Brazilian), and Iâ€™ve decided to start fresh on GitHub to document my journey from the basics to more advanced aspects of C# and .NET.

### About Me
- **Who am I?** A developer with a passion for learning and growth. With two years of experience in C#, Iâ€™m revisiting the basics and updating progressively to advanced .NET topics.
- **Why am I doing this?** I believe that exploring everything from the ground up will strengthen my skills and help me grow as developer.
- **Why C# and .NET?** These are powerful and versatile technologies, and Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and experimenting with them.

### What Youâ€™ll Find Here
- **Learning**: Iâ€™ll be sharing everything from basic C# to more complex .NET projects, tracking my progress along the way.
- **Growing Together**: With two years of experience, Iâ€™m still learning, and Iâ€™m eager to share that journey with anyone interested in following along or collaborating.
- **Letâ€™s Connect**: Whether youâ€™re new to coding or have been at it for a while, feel free to join me as I explore and learn more about C# and .NET.

Thanks for stopping by my profile! Looking forward to connecting and learning together.
